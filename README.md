## Simple editor
Simple image editor, that uses [react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva) and hooks.
Clone repo and run `yarn start` to test it :sparkles:

## What can it do:
* 4 available backgrounds, than can be selected by clicking on it. Click `Delete background` if you want to bring back the default one. `Delete background` is disabled, when no background is selected.
* editable text, with 3 different fonts (one of them is being dynamically fetched). Simply, type in whatever you feel like, click `Add/Edit` text button and customize text position using drag'n'drop. If you decide to remove it, just click on text and a contextual delete icon will show up (no worries, delete icon won't be displayed in the downloaded image :warning: spoiler).
* finally, you can download your piece of art by clicking `Download image` button at the bottom of the page.

## What will be able to do:
- lots of customization
- impress by being glamorous, thanks to [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)

## Why konva, why hooks
hooks = pure awesomeness  
konva = extensible + easy to use + well documented
